# CYF Data Science Project - London 9 - Meysam Arshadi

## Overview
This data science project works with a dataset consisting of 109 projects compiled from the official headquarters of [Khatam-al Anbiya Construction Headquarter's website](https://www.khatam.com/en/home) in 2019.

This project is to navigate the complete data science pipeline, from data collection to presenting results to non-technical audiences, showcasing abilities in data cleaning, analysis, predictive modeling, and effective communication of findings.

## Project Phases

### 1. Selecting a Dataset
- This dataset contains 109 projects from the official headquarters of Khatam al-Anbia in 2019, making it a unique and comprehensive source of information. Khatam al-Anbiya Construction Headquarter is an Iranian engineering firm controlled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and it is on the USA Specially Designated National (SDN) list, which focuses on entities involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems.

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Prepare the data for analysis, addressing missing values, outliers, and data types.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Uncover insights through EDA, revealing patterns and correlations within the project data.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Enhance model performance through feature creation or transformation, and provide the rationale behind feature engineering decisions.

### 5. Predictive Modeling
- Construct relevant predictive models (e.g., regression, classification, time series forecasting).
- Perform model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.
- Document the modeling process, including algorithm choices and their respective advantages and disadvantages.

### 6. Results and Interpretation
- Analyze model results and derive conclusions from the dataset.
- Discuss the significance of your findings within the context of the projects.
- Provide insights into the predictive power of the models and their limitations.

## Deliverables

### 1. Jupyter Notebooks
- Submit Jupyter notebooks with well-documented code, along with detailed explanations.
- Clearly outline the steps taken, assumptions, and challenges encountered during the analysis.

### 2. Presentation
- Prepare a 10-15 minute presentation tailored for non-technical audiences.
- Effectively communicate the problem, data, EDA insights, modeling approach, and results using visuals and accessible language.

## Grading Criteria
- Assessment based on the quality and depth of EDA, organization of Jupyter notebooks, clarity of written sections, and effectiveness in conveying key insights during the presentation.

## Important Considerations
- Ensure that your code is well-documented and organized.
- Cite any external sources or libraries used.
- Adhere to ethical and legal considerations, especially when handling sensitive or personal information in the dataset.

Completing this project demonstrates your ability to manage a full data science project from inception to conclusion while effectively conveying your findings. Best of luck with your data science project!
